The Platform UI plugin does supply a single default Theme and UI Set called @_default@.

There are however not intended for use. They simply exist to provide some form of rendering of content when there is no other Theme or UI Set available.

As such the UI Set does not have a useful implementation of all UI tags, in particular the @ui:field@, @ui:tabs@ and @ui:carousel@ tags are incomplete.

UI Sets should *not* rely on the content of these templates as a default fallback, and should instead always supply all the templates they require.
