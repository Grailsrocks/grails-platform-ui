It is important when developing Themes or trying them out in your app that you can easily select or switch between them.

You can do this easily in development mode without any code. Simply add the _debugThemes=y parameter to your URL in the browser.

You will see a Theme selector with which you can change both the theme *and* the layout of the current page even if the page specifies its own layout. Note that the changes you make are not saved in any way - you will need to update your app code to use the theme and/or layout that you choose.
