Creating your own a theme is relatively easy. It is a matter of creating the standard GSP layouts tailored to your styling and defining the Resources that the theme requires.

You can create a theme from scratch or fork an existing one using the [create-theme|scripts] and [fork-theme|scripts] scripts provided.

Once you have done so you can edit the GSP layouts and resource definitions, add static resources, bespoke tags etc as necessary.
