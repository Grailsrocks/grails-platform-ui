Creating your own a theme is relatively easy. It is a matter of creating the standard GSP layouts tailored to your styling and defining the Resources that the theme requires.

You can create a theme from scratch or fork an existing one using the [create-theme|scripts] and [fork-theme|scripts] scripts provided.

Once you have done so you can edit the GSP layouts and resource definitions, add static resources, bespoke tags etc as necessary.

Each Theme depends on a specific UI Set. The UI Set templates are resolved such that the application or theme can override the template provided by the UI Set. This means your theme can be based on a reusable UI Set and still tweak some rendering. 

Theme layouts render one or more content zones.
