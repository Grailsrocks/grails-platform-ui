h4. Headings

There are UI tags for rendering heading levels 1 to 4, including support for the standard i18n mechanisms of Platform UI.

This allows the UI Set/Theme or any GSP to set the base heading level for the rest of the request, so your content might use @<ui:h1>@ but it actually appears as @<h2>@ in the output. You get to maintain appropriate relative heading levels in your GSP, and let the UI deal with how this actually turns out.

{docx:xml}
<ui:baseHeading level="3"/>
<ui:h1>Heading level 1, or is it</ui:h1>

<ui:baseHeading level="1"/>
<ui:h2 title="my.sub.heading"/>
{docx:xml}
