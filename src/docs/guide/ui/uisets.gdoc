UI Sets provide the implementation of the UI tags, and the named UI Set in effect can be set at runtime.

This is typically automatically selected by the Theme currently in use, but you do not have to use themes to use UI Sets.

A UI Set implementation is just a named collection of GSP templates in a convention-based path in a plugin or application.

h2. Why do we need this?

Even with increasing adoption of HTML5, the truth is that there are still
many ways to render the markup for even the relatively small subset of UI elements that the Platform UI API supports.

Therefore this level of abstraction is required to make Themes work, so that the functionally equivalent visual and input elements can be rendered with completely different structural markup and styling.

Take form fields as an example. These can generally be decomposed into the following components:

# A label
# An input widget of some sort, either standard HTML or some custom JavaScript based widget
# A field hint and/or field error message

So now you take the design your artists have created using e.g. Twitter Bootstrap and you render your fields using the markup required
to achieve Bootstrap's look and feel:

{code:xml}
<label for="firstName" class="control-label">First Name</label>
<div class="controls">
    <input name="firstName" value=""/>
    <span class="help-block">Your first name</span>
</div>
{code}

Fine. However if you then switch to another CSS framework, you will often find that this no longer renders anything like the way you wanted
because there is no standard structural UI layout and styling mechanism in HTML. Specifically:

#Â The structural markup will often be different. One designer might use nested divs to lay out the label, field and hint. Another may use a single div or no div at all for the components, another may rely on the order of sibling elements
# The CSS class names for the structural markup will usually be different
# The CSS class names for the label, widget and hint/error will often be different

So this is why UI Sets delegate to GSP templates that define the actual structural markup for each UI element, and why tags such as [field|uiTags]
automatically handle the label, field and hint so that you are not required to make sure these are surrounded by the correct structural markup for the current theme.

This way, an application can write @<ui:field name="x"/>@ and work with existing and future CSS frameworks without modification to the GSP view - which after all only wanted to render a field.

This is how plugins can expose UI that fits in with the application's chosen theme.

The secret to making your UI work with theming is relinquishing control over the details of HTML markup and CSS classes. 

That is, unless you are also the author of the theme you are using - in which case you still have full control.
