Testing and debugging UI Sets is made easier using the built in previewer tool.

Browse to @http://localhost:8080/<yourapp>/platform/ui@ with your app running, and you will see options
to view the available themese and UI Sets.

You can use the UI Set viewer to show the UI Sample page which includes all UI widgets, using any of the installed UI Sets you have.
