The @_image.gsp@ template is used to render the [image|uiTags] tag.

h3. Contract

This template needs to render an inline image, such as a photo or illustration on the site. Images such as these may support zooming via a lightbox or similar UI, or other decoration such as a frame that would not be applied to other @<img>@ tags.

The template must render the image using the same attribute contract as the Resources @r:img@ tag - i.e. the attributes will contain either a @uri@ or a @dir@/@file@ pair.

h3. Variables available

{table}
*Name* | *Description*
title | Title for the image (if any), resolved from an i18n message code if available. The template might render this with special formatting
imageClass | The CSS class to use for the primary container of the image HTML, obtained from UI Set config.
classes | A string containing the list of CSS classes to apply to the outer container
attrs | The attributes to pass through to the g:form tag. The form is expected to support the standard g:form attributes but need not call g:form as long as it is compatible.
{table}

h3. Example template implementation

{docx:xml}
<div class="${p.joinClasses(values:[imageClass,classes])}">
    <p:callTag tag="r:img"
        attrs="${attrs}" title="${title.encodeAsHTML()}"/>
</div>
{docx}

This example simply delegates to r:img and passes through any classes, after applying a container
