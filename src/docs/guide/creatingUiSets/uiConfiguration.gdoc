UI Sets can change their behaviour based on configuration.

Config paths must be named according to Platform Core namespaced plugin config, within the namespace of the plugin that supplies the UI Set

You can add and declare any configuration options you wish, and for example you could provide more options for CSS Class customisation, or a global switch to change default colours or colour schemes.

In addition there are some Platform UI configuration options that affect UI Sets:

{table}
*Path* | *Type* | *Description*
ui.set | String | The default UI Set to use if none is specified on the request or implied by the request Theme. Defaults to "_default" to use the "demo" UI Set that comes shipped in Platform UI
{table}
