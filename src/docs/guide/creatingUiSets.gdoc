If you cannot find an existing UI Set that generates markup compatible with your chosen or in-house JS/CSS framework, you can create your own. Search the [Grails plugin repository|http://grails.org/plugins/tag/uiset] for plugins that provide UI Sets.

Creating a UI Set is significantly more work than creating a theme because you need to supply the structural markup for all the UI tags. 

However you can create a UI Set based on the @_default@ provided by Platform UI, or fork a UI Set that already exists in your application i.e. one provided by a plugin you have installed. See the [create-ui-set|scripts] and [fork-ui-set|scripts] script documentation.
