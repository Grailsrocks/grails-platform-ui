The application of site branding within a theme is obviously very important.

There are several tools provided in Platform UI to allow Themes to provide diverse branding while minimizing the need for
developers to customize or fork the theme.

The tools available include:

* The smart [logo:uiTags] tag
* Customizable UI Set template for the [logo:uiTags] tag
* The @p:siteName@, @p:siteLink@, @p:siteURL@ tags from Platform Core
* Resource overrides for CSS tweaks
