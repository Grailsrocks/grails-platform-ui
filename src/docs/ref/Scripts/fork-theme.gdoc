h1. fork-theme <theme-name>

The fork-theme script copies an existing Theme installed into your app into a new Theme.

You can then edit the layouts and other elements to customize it.

Note that the Resource modules of a theme will depend on those of the "parent" theme.
If you remove the original theme (e.g. by installing its plugin) you will need to copy the resource modules
from the original theme into yours.
