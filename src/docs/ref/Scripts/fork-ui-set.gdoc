h1. fork-ui-set <ui-set-name>

The fork-ui-set script copies an existing UI set installed into your app into a new UI Set. You can then edit the layouts and other elements to customize it.

Note that the Resource modules of a UI Set will depend on those of the "parent" UI Set.
If you remove the original UI Set (e.g. by installing its plugin) you will need to copy the resource modules
from the original UI Set into yours.
