h1. ui:block

h2. Purpose

Renders a "block" of content. A block is visually distinguished from the surrounding content, as determined by the UI Set.

For example the UI Set or theme may add a border or "well" around the content - perhaps as a @div@ with a specific CSS class. A title may also be rendered in a way defined by the UI Set.

h2. Example

{code:xml}
<ui:block title="section.titles.welcome">
    <p>Thank you for visiting our awesome site.</p>
</ui:block>
{code}

The body is rendered as the body of the block section.

*Name* | *Required?* | *Description*
title | No | An 18n message code to resolve and render as the title of the block, or inline text
titleArgs | No | Optional argument list for the i18n message
