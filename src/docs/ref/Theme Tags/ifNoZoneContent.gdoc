h1. theme:ifNoZoneContent

h2. Purpose

Executes the body only if there is no content explicitly defined for the specified content zone.

Content zones can have optional content, and if the application's GSP does not define any content for a zone, you can test this and take alternative action.

For example your theme may render alternative content on the "sidebar" layout if there is no content defined for the sidebar.

h2. Example

{docx:xml}
<theme:ifNoZoneContent name="panel1">
    Google Adsense Here
</theme:ifNoZoneContent>
{docx}

h2. Attributes
