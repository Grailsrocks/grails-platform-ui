h1. theme:set

h2. Purpose

Sets the theme to use for the current request.

You may want to set the theme in use from inside a controller action or a GSP view. Use this tag to do so. Note that a controller can 
also call directly into the @grailsThemes.setRequestTheme@ method to do the same without tag overheads.

h2. Example

{docx:xml}
<theme:set name="customAdmin"/>
{docx}

h2. Attributes

{table}
*Name* | *Required?* | *Description*
